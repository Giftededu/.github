## The Learning Analytics in STEM Education Research (LASER) Institute 

A significant portion of the LASER Institute consists of Learning Labs, which are designed to provide scholars with a conceptual understanding of, and applied experience with, working with new types of data using **foundational skills** (e.g., data wrangling, visualization) and advanced techniques such as  **network analysis**, **text mining**, and **machine learning**. 

Each learning lab begins with a presentation and code-along, followed by guided and independent practice activities hosted on the LASER Institute GitHub site.
