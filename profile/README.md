## The Learning Analytics in STEM Education Research (LASER) Institute 

A significant portion of the LASER Institute consists of Learning Labs, which are designed to provide scholars with a conceptual understanding of, and applied experience with, analyzing educational data using **foundational-skills** (e.g., data wrangling, visualization) and advanced techniques such as  **machine-learning**, **text-mining**, and **network-analysis**. Each pinned GitHub repository contains four learning labs consisiting of guided and independent activities including:
1.  **Overview Presentations** and a code-along to introduce basic concepts and R skills; 
2.  **Essential Readings** to deepen your understanding of core concepts; 
3.  **Tutorials or Case Studies** for guided practice analyizing educational data with R;
4.  **Learning Lab Badge** that you can earn by demonstrating basic compentencies.
