## The Learning Analytics in STEM Education Research (LASER) Institute 

A significant portion of the LASER Institute consists of Learning Labs, which are designed to provide scholars with a conceptual understanding of, and applied experience with, analyzing educational data using **foundational skills** (e.g., data wrangling, visualization) and advanced techniques such as  **machine learning**, **text mining**, and **network analysis**. 

Each pinned GitHub repository below contains four learning labs consisiting of guided and independent activities including:
1. A facilitator-led <u>presentation and code-along</u>, 
2. Essential readings to deepen your understanding of core concepts
3. Tutorials or case studies for guided practice with essential R skills;
4. 

guided for each of these focus areasbegins with a presentation and code-along, followed by guided and independent practice activities hosted on the LASER Institute GitHub site.
